This repository contains an implementation of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to align two point clouds, namely the source and target point clouds. The ICP algorithm is widely used for point cloud registration and alignment in various applications.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
  
You can install them using:
```bash
pip install open3d numpy
```

## Implementation

The code provides an implementation of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for aligning two point clouds. Customize the script to load your source and target point clouds, then run the ICP algorithm to achieve alignment.
